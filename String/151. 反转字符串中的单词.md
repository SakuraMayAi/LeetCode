# 151. 反转字符串中的单词

Problem Link: https://leetcode.cn/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/

## Solution

Use an array whose type is `vector<string>` to store all the words. Use a string variable `word` to store each character. Traversal the string `s` from the beginning. If the character is not a `' '`, we add it to the end of the `word`. When the character is a `' '`, we push the `word` which must not equal " " back to the `words`. After the `while` loop, there may still be a string in the `word` so we still need to push it back to the `words`.

```cpp
string reverseWords(string s)
{
    int i = 0;
    string word = "";
    vector<string> words;
    while (i < s.size())
    {
        if (s[i] != ' ') word += s[i++];
        else
        {
            while (s[i] == ' ') ++i;
            if (word != "") words.push_back(word);
            word.clear();
        }
    }
    if (word != "") words.push_back(word);
    word = words[words.size() - 1];
    for (int k = words.size() - 2; k >= 0; --k)
        word += (' ' + words[k]);

    return word;
}
```
