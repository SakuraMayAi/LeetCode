# 344. 反转字符串

Problem Link: https://leetcode.cn/problems/reverse-string/description/

## Solution

```cpp
void reverseString(vector<char>& s)
{
    if (s.size() == 0) return;
    for (int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1; i < j; ++i, --j)
		swap(s[i], s[j]);
}
```

Here we introduce an operation to swap the value of two **integers** `a` and `b`. That is XOR(`^`) operation.
```cpp
a ^= b;
b ^= a;
a ^= b;
```
Below is the proof process using the properties of XOR (commutative and associative).
1. `a ^= b`: `a` becomes `a ^ b`.
2. `b ^= a`: `b` becomes `b ^ (a ^ b)` = `(b ^ b) ^ a` = `0 ^ a` = `a`.
3. `a ^= b`: `a` becomes `(a ^ b) ^ a` = `a ^ (a ^ b)` = `0 ^ b` = `b`.

### Remember that this method is only suitable for two **integers**!
