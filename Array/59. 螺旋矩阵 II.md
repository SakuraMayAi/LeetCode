# Solution 1

As is shown in the pictures below,

![n=3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccee6a5e-2eeb-4f3a-976b-d04739108082) ![n=4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de900f95-9cec-4b81-97b1-3de49b92ee7d)

The question wants us to fill a two-dimensional array with numbers from 0 to $n * n$ in spiral order. I divided the filling process into many rounds in a `for` loop. It's obvious that how many rounds we need depends on the `n`. The conversion formula is $rounds = (n + 1) / 2$. In every round, use four `while` loops to represent four fill directions. `plus_bound` and `minus_bound` are obersved from the pictures. But it can't fill the middle grid when the `n` is an odd number thus I need to fill it manually out of the loop. There is a simpler way to solve this--change the first line code to `vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(n, n * n))`.
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n)
{
    vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    int fill = 1;
    int plus_bound = n - 2, minus_bound = 1;
    for (int p = 0, q = 0; p < (n + 1) / 2 && q < (n + 1) / 2; ++p, ++q)
    {
        int i = p, j = q;   // i and j start from p and q respectively every round.
        while (j <= plus_bound) res[i][j++] = fill++;
        while (i <= plus_bound) res[i++][j] = fill++;
        while (j >= minus_bound) res[i][j--] = fill++;
        while (i >= minus_bound) res[i--][j] = fill++;
        --plus_bound; ++minus_bound;
    }
    if (n % 2 == 1) res[(n - 1) / 2][(n - 1) / 2] = fill;   // Fill the middle element.

    return res;
}
```

# Solution 2

Improvement to solution 1. The key is that if the next element equals 0, we fill it with `fill`. In this way, we can also avoid out-of-bounds.
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n)
{
    vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    int fill = 2;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    res[0][0] = 1;  // Fill the first element.
    while (fill <= n * n)
    {
        while (j < n - 1 && res[i][j + 1] == 0) res[i][++j] = fill++;
        while (i < n - 1 && res[i + 1][j] == 0) res[++i][j] = fill++;
        while (j > 0 && res[i][j - 1] == 0) res[i][--j] = fill++;
        while (i > 0 && res[i - 1][j] == 0) res[--i][j] = fill++;
    }

    return res;
}
```

# Solution 3

A new way to solve the problem. Same as solution 2, take the value of each element to judge if it needs to be filled. But we choose a new way to avoid out-of-bounds. Thus we can fill all the elements in one loop.
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n)
{
    vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    int dx = 0, dy = 1; // (dx, dy) is a direction vector
    int x = 0, y = 0;   // [x, y] is a cordinate.
    for (int i = 1; i <= n * n; ++i)
    {
        res[x][y] = i;
        if (res[(x + dx + n) % n][(y + dy + n) % n] != 0)	// Change the direction of the fill each time it goes to the boundary.
        {   
			int tmp = dy;
            dy = -dx;
            dx = tmp;
        }
        x += dx;
        y += dy;
    }

    return res;
}
```
