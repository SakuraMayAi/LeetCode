# 59. 螺旋矩阵 II
Problem Link: https://leetcode.cn/problems/spiral-matrix-ii/description/

Solution 1: As is shown in the pictures below,

![n=3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccee6a5e-2eeb-4f3a-976b-d04739108082) ![n=4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de900f95-9cec-4b81-97b1-3de49b92ee7d)

The question wants us to fill a two-dimensional array with numbers from 0 to $n * n$ in spiral order. I divided the filling process into many rounds in a `for` loop. It's obvious that how many rounds we need depends on the `n`. The conversion formula is $rounds = (n + 1) / 2$. In every round, use four `while` loops to represent four fill directions. `plus_bound` and `minus_bound` are obersved from the pictures. But it can't fill the middle grid when the `n` is an odd number thus I had to fill it manually out of the loop. I hope someone can solve this one day.
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n)
{
    vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    int fill = 1;
    int plus_bound = n - 2, minus_bound = 1;
    for (int p = 0, q = 0; p < (n + 1) / 2 && q < (n + 1) / 2; ++p, ++q)
    {
        int i = p, j = q;   // i and j start from p and q respectively every round.
        while (j <= plus_bound) res[i][j++] = fill++;
        while (i <= plus_bound) res[i++][j] = fill++;
        while (j >= minus_bound) res[i][j--] = fill++;
        while (i >= minus_bound) res[i--][j] = fill++;
        --plus_bound; ++minus_bound;
    }
    if (n % 2 == 1) res[(n - 1) / 2][(n - 1) / 2] = fill;   // Fit for odd n.

    return res;
}
```
