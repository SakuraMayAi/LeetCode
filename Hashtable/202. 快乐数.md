## Solution

**Hash table**: Use a `Hash` whose type is `unordered_map` to store the numbers that have appeared.   The`qsum` means square sum and tmp is used to store the value of `qsum` at the beginning of each `while` loop.   We calculate the new square sum in the `do... while` loop and judge wether it equals 1.   If it is not, we get into the next `while` loop.

```cpp
unordered_map<int, int> Hash;
bool isHappy(int n)
{
    int qsum = n, tmp;
    while (Hash[qsum] == 0)
    {
        Hash[qsum] = 1;
        tmp = qsum, qsum = 0;
        do {
            qsum += (tmp % 10) * (tmp % 10);
            tmp /= 10;
        } while (tmp != 0);
        if (qsum == 1) return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```
