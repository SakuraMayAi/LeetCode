## Solution 1
**Hash table**: **Sort the array `nums` first(it's very important)**. Then use a `for` loop to traverse the `nums`. If we fix  `nums[i]`, the problem is transformed to a [Two sum](https://github.com/SakuraMayAi/LintCode/blob/main/Hashtable/1.%20%E4%B8%A4%E6%95%B0%E4%B9%8B%E5%92%8C.md) question. The difference is that the `target` now is `0 - nums[i]` and we term this process, which finds two numbers added up to `target`, as finding pairs.

In the second level `for` loop, we traverse the `nums`  start from the next element of `nums[i]`.    The basic process is like this: when we meet the element `nums[j]`, we need to check whether its paired element `target - nums[j]` appears in the interval  `[j + 1, nums.size() - 1]` of `nums`.    The question now is where to find it.    In the unordered set `ust`.    If one couldn't find its pair, we insert it into `ust`, representing it appearing in the `nums`.    And if we can find its pair, that means we find three numbers, which are `nums[i]`, `nums[j]` and `0 - nums[i] - nums[j]`, whose sum is 0. Then we construct a new vector with `nums[i]`, `0 - nums[i] - nums[j]` and `nums[j]` and push it back to the ans.

When the `nums` is large, this process is bound to time out in the real run. So, we have to get rid of duplicate triplets, which is pruning. Below are explanations of each pruning operation.

1. `if (nums[i] > 0)`: Cause we sort the `nums` at first, if`nums[i]` is greater than 0, all the elements after `nums[i]` are bound to be greater than 0 too.    So we break the loop.
2. `if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1])`: The whole process of this program is like fixing `nums[i]` and finding pairs.    If we already found a pair for `nums[i - 1]`, we needn't find it again for `nums[i]` that equals to `nums[i - 1]`.    So we just need to get into the next loop.
3. `if (j > i + 2 && nums[j] == nums[j - 1] && nums[j - 1] == nums[j - 2])`: In case of missing the subsequence `{ 0, 0, 0 }`.
4. `ust.erase(0 - nums[i] - nums[j])`: Imagine such an array `{ -2, 0, 0, 2, 2 }`.    When the `nums[i]` is -2 and `nums[j]` is 2 now.    The `ust` now is `{ 0 }` and 0 is just what we need to pair with `nums[j]`.    So we push a `vector<int> { -2, 0, 2}` back to the ans. Then we get into the next loop and `nums[j]` is 2 again.    What are we gonna do?    Push it back again?    Hell no but the program will do it because we don't set any code to prevent this. So how to do it?    By erasing 0 from the `ust` cause we don't need to pair 0 anymore.    Some people may ask what if the `nums` is { -2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2 }?    Remember that, we sort the `nums` at first so all the 0 and 2 are consecutive.
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums)
{
    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
    {
        if (nums[i] > 0) break;
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;
        unordered_set<int> ust;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); ++j)
        {
            if (j > i + 2 && nums[j] == nums[j - 1] && nums[j - 1] == nums[j - 2]) continue;
            if (ust.find(0 - nums[i] - nums[j]) != ust.end())
            {
                ans.push_back(vector<int>{ nums[i], 0 - nums[i] - nums[j], nums[j] });
                ust.erase(0 - nums[i] - nums[j]);
            }
            else ust.insert(nums[j]);
        }
    }

    return ans;
}
```

## Solution 2

**Two pointers**: Use two pointers `left` and `right` that point to the `i + 1` and `nums.size() - 1` respectively.  Basically same as the solution 1 but the difference is that the pair we need to find now turns to `nums[left] + nums[right]`.  If `nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] > 0`, we need to shift the `right` to left to reduce the sum, otherwise shift the `left` to right.  If `nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] = 0`, we push these three numbers into the `ans`.  The next step is pruning.  Cause the `nums` is sorted, we just need to minus `right` or `plus` continually. 

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums)
{
    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
    {
        if (nums[i] > 0) break;
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;
        int left = i + 1;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (right > left)
        {
            if (nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] > 0) --right;
            else if (nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] < 0) ++left;
            else
            {
                ans.push_back(vector<int>{ nums[i], nums[left], nums[right] });
                while (right > left && nums[right] == nums[right - 1]) --right;
                while (right > left && nums[left] == nums[left + 1]) ++left;
                --right;
                ++left;
            }
        }
    }

    return ans;
}
```
