# 160. 相交链表

Problem Link: https://leetcode.cn/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/description/

## Solution 1

**Two pointers**: It should be noted that the node at which the two linked lists intersect means the pointer to the node is equal, not the value of the node is equal. Calculate the length of the two linked list and align their tail nodes by moving the pointer(may be `pA` or `pB`) of the longer linked list to the node coresspond to the head node of the shoter linked list. Then move `pA` and `pB` synchronously. Return `pA` or `pB` once they are equal or else `nullptr` after `while` loop terminates.

```cpp
ListNode* getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB)
{
    int lenA = 0, lenB = 0;
    ListNode* pA = headA;
    ListNode* pB = headB;
    for (; pA != nullptr; ++lenA) pA = pA->next;
    for (; pB != nullptr; ++lenB) pB = pB->next;
    int gap = lenA > lenB ? lenA - lenB : lenB - lenA;
    pA = headA, pB = headB;
    if (lenA > lenB)
        while (gap--) pA = pA->next;
    else while (gap--) pB = pB->next;
    while (pA != nullptr && pB != nullptr)
    {
        if (pA == pB) return pA;
        pA = pA->next;
        pB = pB->next;
    }
    return nullptr;
}
```

## Solution 2

An improvement to solution 1.   In this solution, we don't calculate the length of the two linked lists.   In the `while` loop, the pointer who points to the shorter list is gonna become `nullptr` first and then point to the head node of the longer list in the next loop. The other which points to the longer one at the beginning will subsequently become `nullptr` in a certain loop and point to the head node of the shorter one in the next loop.   At this time, these two pointers are in the corresponding position where the tail node is aligned. If these two lists don't intersect with each other, `pA` and `pB` will become `nullptr` at the same time and then get out of the `while` loop.

```cpp
ListNode* getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB)
{
    if (headA == nullptr || headB == nullptr) return nullptr;
    ListNode* pA = headA;
    ListNode* pB = headB;
    while (pA != pB)
    {
        pA = pA == nullptr ? headB : pA->next;
        pB = pB == nullptr ? headA : pB->next;
    }
    
    return pA;
}
```
