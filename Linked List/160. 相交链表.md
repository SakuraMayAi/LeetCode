# 160. 相交链表

## Solution 1

**Two pointers**: It should be noted that the node at which the two lists intersect means the pointer to the node is equal, not the value of the node is equal. Calculate the length of the two linked list and align their tail nodes by moving the pointer(may be `pA` or `pB`) of the longer linked list to the node coresspond to the head node of the shoter linked list. Then move `pA` and `pB` synchronously. Return `pA` or `pB` once they are equal or else `nullptr` after `while` loop terminates.

```cpp
ListNode* getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB)
{
    int lenA = 0, lenB = 0;
    ListNode* pA = headA;
    ListNode* pB = headB;
    for (; pA != nullptr; ++lenA) pA = pA->next;
    for (; pB != nullptr; ++lenB) pB = pB->next;
    int gap = lenA > lenB ? lenA - lenB : lenB - lenA;
    pA = headA, pB = headB;
    if (lenA > lenB)
        while (gap--) pA = pA->next;
    else while (gap--) pB = pB->next;
    while (pA != nullptr && pB != nullptr)
    {
        if (pA == pB) return pA;
        pA = pA->next;
        pB = pB->next;
    }
    return nullptr;
}
```
