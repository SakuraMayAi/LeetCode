# 142. 环形链表 II

Problem Link: https://leetcode.cn/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/description/

## Solution 1
**Fast and slow pointers**: Use two pointers pointing to the head at the beginning. The fast one `p` moves one node while the slow one `q` moves two nodes in each loop. As time passes, the `q` is bound to meet the `p` at some node in the ring if the linked list has a cycle, or else quit the `while` loop when `q` or `q->next` equals `nullptr`.

But the node they meet is not the node where the cycle begins, we still need another `while` loop to find the entry of the cycle. One example is shown in the gifs.

```cpp
ListNode* detectCycle(ListNode* head)
{
    ListNode* p = head; // Slow node.
    ListNode* q = head; // Fast node.
    while (q != nullptr && q->next != nullptr)
    {   // Circular linked list has no nullptr pointer.
        p = p->next;
        q = q->next->next;
        if (p == q) // Have cycle.
        {
            p = head;
            while (p != q)
            {
                p = p->next;
                q = q->next;
            }
            return p;
        }
    }

    return nullptr;
}
```

# Solution 2

**A cunning approach**: Considering that the heap addresses grow from lower to higher, and given that LeetCode's linked list memory is allocated contiguously. So in this case, the address of each node must be less than its `next` pointer value like what is shown in the left picture. So if there is a cycle present, the pointer `p` must be bigger than or equal to the `p->next` like what is shown in the right picture.
